#Pixelpusher

Theme for the [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org) publishing platform

##Features
* Responsive (1000px down to low mobile resolution)
* Custom Featured Image (If post has image as first line, it is used as preview in index and as header in the post view.)
* Google Web fonts (**Open Sans** for text and **Exo 2** for headlines)
* Headline resizing using [**Fittext**](https://github.com/davatron5000/FitText.js)
* No pagination, "Load Older Posts ->" loads new posts dynamically and with a subtle fade-in
* Looks great!
